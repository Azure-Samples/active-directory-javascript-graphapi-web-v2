### Vanilla JavaScript SPA using Microsoft Identity Platform to Sign-in Users and Call Microsoft Graph API
------------
There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the **Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript**.

Check it out here: [active-directory-javascript-graphapi-v2](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-graphapi-v2)

If you really need a sample that uses the **hello.js** library for authentication, you can navigate to the master branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
